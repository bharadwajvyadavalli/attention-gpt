# GPT Language Model

This repository contains an implementation of a GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer) language model using PyTorch. The GPT model is a type of transformer neural network that excels at generating coherent and contextually relevant text based on a given input. It has been widely used in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as text completion, translation, and summarization due to its powerful generative capabilities.

   cd gpt-language-model
   ```

   ```

## Implementation Details

### Imports and Hyperparameters

The initial part of the implementation involves importing necessary libraries and defining hyperparameters for the model, such as batch size, block size, learning rate, and device configuration.

### Load and Prepare Data

We read the input text file and process it to create a mapping from characters to integers and vice versa. This step also includes splitting the data into training and validation sets.

### Data Loading

A function `get_batch` is defined to generate batches of data for training and evaluation. Another function `estimate_loss` is provided to calculate the loss on the training and validation sets without updating the model parameters.

### Model Definition

The model consists of several classes:

- `Head`: Implements a single head of self-attention.
- `MultiHeadAttention`: Implements multiple heads of self-attention in parallel.
- `FeedForward`: A simple feed-forward network.
- `Block`: A transformer block that includes communication (multi-head attention) followed by computation (feed-forward network).
- `GPTLanguageModel`: The main language model class that combines the above components.

### Attention and Multi-Head Attention

**Attention** is a mechanism that allows the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence when generating an output. It computes a weighted sum of input values, where the weights are determined by the relevance of each input to the current processing step. This enables the model to capture long-range dependencies and relationships in the data.

**Multi-Head Attention** enhances the attention mechanism by running multiple attention layers, or "heads," in parallel. Each head operates on a different part of the input, allowing the model to learn and attend to different aspects of the data simultaneously. The outputs of these heads are then concatenated and linearly transformed to produce the final result. This approach allows the model to capture more nuanced and complex patterns in the input data.

### Transformer Block and Language Model

The `Block` class encapsulates a transformer block, and the `GPTLanguageModel` class integrates multiple transformer blocks, along with embedding layers and a final linear layer to produce output logits.

### Model Training and Text Generation

The training loop involves generating batches of data, computing the loss, and updating the model parameters using the AdamW optimizer. Additionally, the `generate` method in the `GPTLanguageModel` class allows for generating new text based on a given input context.

## Usage

1. Run the Jupyter notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook gpt_language_model.ipynb
   ```

2. Follow the steps in the notebook to train the model and generate text.

3. The notebook will save the generated text to `more.txt` after training.
