# AttentionGPT: Deep Dive into Attention Mechanisms

Welcome to the AttentionGPT project, part of our comprehensive Large Language Model (LLM) series. This project focuses on understanding and implementing Attention and Multi-Head Attention mechanisms in PyTorch, which are foundational elements of modern NLP models like GPT.

## Core Components

### Understanding Attention Mechanisms

Attention allows a model to focus on specific parts of the input sequence when generating each word in the output sequence, similar to how humans pay attention to different aspects of a context when understanding or generating language. This enables the model to consider the relevance of different words and phrases, resulting in more coherent and contextually appropriate outputs.

### Multi-Head Attention

Building on the basic Attention mechanism, Multi-Head Attention enhances the model's capability by allowing it to focus on different parts of the input sequence simultaneously. This is achieved by projecting the input into multiple attention heads, each with its own set of weights, enabling the model to capture a richer set of dependencies and contextual cues from the input data.

### Implementing GPT

The `gpt.py` script provides a detailed implementation of a Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) model. Key components include:

- **Embedding Layers**: Converting input tokens into dense vector representations.
- **Positional Encoding**: Adding positional information to the token embeddings to account for the order of words.
- **Attention Mechanisms**: Implementing both Attention and Multi-Head Attention layers.
- **Feed-Forward Neural Networks**: Processing the attention outputs through additional layers to capture higher-level features.
- **Output Layers**: Generating the final token predictions.

By delving into the `gpt.py` script, you'll gain a comprehensive understanding of how GPT models are constructed, trained, and fine-tuned for various NLP tasks.
